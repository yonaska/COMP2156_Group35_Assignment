DevOps plays a vital role in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) by integrating development and operations teams. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery, which helps organizations reduce development cycles and improve software quality. By adopting DevOps practices, companies can release software updates faster, respond to market demands more effectively, and ensure better stability and performance of the software.
